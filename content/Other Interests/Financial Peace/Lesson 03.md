# Emergency Fund

- Your emergency fund is insurance, not an investment! 
	- It prevents you from going back into debt.
- When you use your emergency fund, BUILD it back up.

# Notes
- Murphy’s Law states: Anything that can go wrong **WILL** go wrong.

# Activities
- Stay Gazelle Intense
	- Turn to page 52, and let’s look at the case study about two couples who are saving for Baby Step 3. Work through the case study. Then we’ll discuss the answers, as well as how you can stay focused even after you’re debt-free.
	- Answers
		- Because both couples have already saved $1,000 from Baby Step 1, they need $11,000 to finish their emergency fund. 
		- It will take Brian and Heather nearly 37 months. The math for that is $11,000 divided by $300. 
		- Because Ashton and Kelsey were gazelle intense, it will take them just 11 months. The math for that is $11,000 divided by $1,000.
