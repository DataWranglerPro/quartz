# How to Invest 15% of your income?
- If your company offers a Roth 401(k) with a match and good mutual fund options:
	- Invest the entire 15% in that plan.
- If your company offers a traditional 401(k) with a match:
	- Invest an amount equal to the match.
	- Next, invest up to the limit in a Roth IRA.
	- If you have a higher income and hit the Roth IRA limit before you’ve invested 15% of your income, go back to the 401(k) and finish your investing there.
