# Discussion Questions
1. When have you let the cost of insurance dictate how much insurance you get in a certain policy? How does this lesson challenge you to think differently? 

2. How do you see your fully funded emergency fund fitting into your insurance plan? How can you make sure you have the right balance between the two? 

3. Everyone 18 or older needs a written will. Do you have a will? If not, what has been holding you back from getting one? 

4. Can you imagine building wealth to the point where you can self-insure? Why or why not? How have the Baby Steps moved you closer to making that a reality?
