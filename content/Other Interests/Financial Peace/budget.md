**A zero-based budget simply means your income minus your expenses equals zero**. One more time: Your income minus everything else equals zero. That means you give every dollar a job to do every month. Hint: That’s why we named our tool EveryDollar. Make a plan on purpose for every dollar, every month.

# IT’S TIME TO FILL OUT THE QUICK-START BUDGET

- [ ] STEP 1
	Write down what you’re spending for the month in each item of 
	each category. If you don’t know exact numbers, just make your 
	best guess!

- [ ] STEP 2
	Add up each item in each category and write the TOTAL at 
	the bottom.

- [ ] STEP 3
	Add up the numbers in all of the TOTAL boxes and write that 
	number in the TOTAL FOR ALL CATEGORIES box.
