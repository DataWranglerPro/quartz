# Discussion Questions
1. When you picture your dream home, what do you see? What parts of your home stand out, and why are they important to you? 

2. Based on what you’ve learned from Dave, how do you know if you have too much house? 

3. Based on your answer to the last question, do you need to make any adjustments to your housing situation? If so, what? Refinance? Downsize? Throw more money at your mortgage? 

4. If you’re a homeowner, think about life without a mortgage. What could you do with the extra money that’s currently going toward payments? If you’re renting, how do you feel about owning a home someday? How could you save up for one?
