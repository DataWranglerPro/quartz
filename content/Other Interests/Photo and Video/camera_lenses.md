1. Zoom vs. Prime
	1. Prime 50mm @1.4
		1. The target is in focus and the background is blurry
		2. You cannot zoom so you have to physically move to zoom in or out
		3. Need less amount of light
	3. Zoom 24-105mm @4.0
		1. You can get multiple shots without moving since you are able to zoom in/out
	5. Zoom 17-40mm @4.0
		1. This is a super wide angle lens
		2. Good for action shots, youtube videos
	7. Notes
		1. The lower the mm the wider the angle
		2. The higher the mm the more telephoto, allows you to see further
