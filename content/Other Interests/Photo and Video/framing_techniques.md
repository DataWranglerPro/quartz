# The rule of thirds
The rule of thirds is a guideline for composing visual elements in a film or photograph. The basic principle is to divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically, creating nine equal parts. The key elements of the scene, such as the subject or the horizon, should be placed along these lines or at the points where they intersect. This creates a sense of balance and tension in the image, and can lead to more visually pleasing and dynamic compositions. It's not a hard and fast rule but a general guidance for creating more interesting and dynamic shots.

Examples of the rule of thirds in film making:
- In a shot of a person standing in a field, the person's eyes would align with the top horizontal third line, and their body would be placed slightly off-center along the left vertical third line.
- In a shot of a sunset over the ocean, the horizon would align with the bottom horizontal third line, and the sun would be placed off-center along the right vertical third line.
- In a shot of a person walking down a city street, the person's eyes would align with the top horizontal third line, and their feet would be placed on the left vertical third line.
