- Exposure - The overall brightness of your image
	- ISO - digitally adds more light to the picture
		- The higher the number the brighter the image will be
		- The higher the number the more grainy/noisy the image will be
		- The idea is to get ISO as low as possible
	- Shutter Speed - the amount of time each frame is exposed to light
		- The lower the shutter speed, the longer each frame is exposed to light
		- Suggestions
			- 1/100 and above for action shots
			- Make shutter speed to double the frame rate for a "natural" film look (i.e. 24fps=>1/50)
	- Aperture - the amount of light let in through the opening of the lens
		- Pick a high f/stop number to make everything in focus
			- Good for landscape, action, wide shots
		- Pick a low f/stop number
			- Makes things in front and behind target blurry. Only the target is sharp
			- Good for interviews, cinematic look
- Latitude/Dynamic Range - The amount of dark to bright light the sensor can handle
	- Cheaper cameras have a lower latitude and the dark or bright parts of the image are blown up
- Picture profile - the in camera color grading that is put into your image
- White balance - gives a specific value to the color white
- Focal length - the angle of view that the lens lets into the camera
- Frame rate - the amount of frames per second that the camera records
	- Non action shots - Always shoot at 24 fps. Shutter speed at ~1/60
	- For slow motion shots - Shoot at 60 fps
	- 30 fps will give you a fake, tv broadcast, home movies look
