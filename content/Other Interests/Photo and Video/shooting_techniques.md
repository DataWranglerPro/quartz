# The techniques are what tells the viewer how to feel

1. Zooming vs. Moving the camera
	1. Zooming with the lens/phone will enlarge/magnify what is at the center of the image
	2. Moving the camera means we are physically moving towards the target. This gives us a more dynamic shot as the background also changes as we move.
1. Shot life cycle
	2. Beginning - This can be a pull in shot
	3. Middle - This can be a gimbal shot
	4. End - This can be a pull away shot
1. Shoot multiple takes
	1. Do 3-5 takes of the same shot
		1. Try different camera movements/angles
		2. Make sure shots are clear and do not include things/persons you don't want in the frame
1. Every video made has two different types of coverage
	1. A roll coverage - main layer of footage
		1. This footage is shot first
	4. B roll coverage - secondary shots
		1. Cut away shots, inserts, close ups
		2. This can be an object of importance
		3. You are showing the audience other important things to take note of
1. Order of shots
	1. Shot your wide shots first
	2. Shot your close up next
1. Shooting an interview with one camera
	1. Pick one good angle
	2. Have a good amount of B-rolls to make the video more interesting
1. If you are shooting with two cameras
	1. Have at least 45 degrees between the two cameras
		1. So when you jump from one camera to the next there is enough contrast.
	4. You can also dedicate cameras
		1. One does a wide angle and the other does medium or close ups
1. 180 degree rule
	1. When filming, people or objects are going to be facing a certain direction
	2. If you move the camera too much to one side, the person/object will no look like they are facing a different direction. This will mess you up in post production. This will confuse the audience.
1. Create balanced frame
	1. A person in the middle of a frame is balanced
	2. If we move them to the left, there will be a "void" on the right side of the frame
		1. If we place an object on the right side of this example, it creates a balanced frame and makes the shot more cinematic
