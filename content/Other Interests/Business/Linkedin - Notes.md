# Understanding Views and Impressions
- **Regular Post:** Counts how often LinkedIn™ displays your post in your network's timeline—a basic measure of reach. 
- **Articles/Newsletters:** Tracks the number of clicks on your article to open for reading, indicating reader engagement—a more reliable performance metric. 
- **Native Video Content:** Records the number of individuals who have viewed your video, either by clicking or through autoplay, for a minimum of six seconds—a metric indicative of high engagement.

# Optimal Text + Single Image Post
- Ideal Text Length: 900 - 1,200 characters.

- More images increase reach, but it's best to limit it to five.

- While timing can usually be flexible, it should correspond with the message's intent.
- These posts are best suited for storytelling and sharing infographics.

- Avoid too brief content; posts under 1,000 characters typically see a 25% drop in reach.
- Ensure a concise and clear structure.
- Thoughtful formatting can positively influence reach and engagement.
- Invest effort in crafting compelling hooks and conclusions.
- There is no negative impact for posting multiple text-only posts in succession.
