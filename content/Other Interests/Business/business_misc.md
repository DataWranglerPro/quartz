# EXIT Profit Levers:

1. Price levers
	1. The billing cycle
		1. Stop charging monthly
			1. Charge every 7, 14, 28 days
			2. It's easier to sell 7 day billing as the price will look cheaper
			3. If you charge $200 per month, change to $49 every 7 days (30/7 * 49 = 210). So you actually make a little more per customer and it is easier to sell $49 every 7 days than $200 a month.
			4. If you increase weekly price from $34 to $39, this doesn't look like much, but it is. It is (30/7 * 34 = 145.7143) vs (30/7 * 39 = 167.1429). Thatâ€™s a $20 increase per month.
			5. If you go with $49 every 7 days, bill the customer on a 28 day billing cycle.
		1. Price of service
			1. If you really want to help people, you have to make it a priority for your customers. Nothing does that better than money. So make sure to increase your prices. Don't be afraid, charge more.
3. Capacity Levers
	1. Number of showings per week
	2. Number of open houses per week
	3. Duration of showing per week
	4. Duration of open houses per week
	5. How many showing or open houses an agent can do in a week
	6. Limit number of available sessions
		1. Schedule in advance
		2. Offer less popular days/times first
		3. Don't offer unlimited services
		4. Instead of allowing clients to show up anytime any day of the week. Limit to 3 times a week (M|W|F or T|TH|S). This way you know when customer is supposed to show up and hold them accountable, send them reminders.
	1. Have cancellation fees for no shows ($15)
		1. Tell them you are taking up a spot of someone who wants to come
		2. This is an accountability measure
5. Overhead levers
	1. How much does it cost to service a buyer monthly
	2. How much does it cost to service a seller monthly
	3. Rent
	4. Utilities
	5. Internet
	6. Phone
	7. Office supplies
	8. Marketing
	9. Software
	10. Licenses
	11. Organization fees
	12. EXIT fees
	13. Agent commissions
	14. Events
	15. Conferences
	16. Training
