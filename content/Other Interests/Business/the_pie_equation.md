# How do you know how your business is doing?

## The equations below gives you three hypothetical maxes

- 5 new customer per month / 10% churn
	- What is the maximum number of customers I can have? 50
	- This tells me at this rate 50 is the maximum number of customers I can get
	- I would need to increase the number of customer I get per month or decrease my churn to grow the business
	- If you have more customers than the theoretical max, you will be losing customers in the future
- 1000 is the average revenue per client and 20% leave every month
	- This tells you how much each customer is worth? $5000
	- This helps you know how much to spend on marketing to get a customer
	- LTV = price*margin/churn
- 10k of new business every month, losing 10% customers monthly
	- How much can I make per month? 100,000

| Inflow | 5 | 1000 | 10000 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Outflow | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.10 |

## For real estate:
- How many leads did you get this month
	- How many leads signed a contract
- How many deals can an agent handle at one time
- Cac
	- How much do you spend on marketing every month
	- How many leads do you generate every month
	- How many leads complete the transaction within one year
	- Formula (leads/competed transactions) / monthly marketing costs
		- 10/2 * 200 = 1,000
- Agent count
- Under contract
- Closed transactions
- Average listing price, average buyer price
- Average commission %
