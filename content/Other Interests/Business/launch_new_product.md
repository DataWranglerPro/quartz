# How to Launch a New Product

==DO NOT JUST PUT AN AD THAT SAYS, HERE Is OUT NEW ---------, HERE IS THE LINK, SIGNUP/BUY IT…. This does not work==

- Let people start to know about your new product well in advanced (one month out)
	- Target your free group, your current customers (warmer group)
	- Create a post with a count down timer and the logo of the new product
		- You don't even need to have the product ready
		- No copy needed, just write it is coming…
- A week later do the same thing but with less days in the count down timer
	- We are about 3 weeks out at this point
	- You can also send one email
- A week later do the same thing but with less days in the count down timer
	- We are about 2 weeks out at this point
	- You can also send one email
- 10 days before the actual launch date, you start to max marketing
	- Do 5 emails, one every other day
	- Your goal is address any concerns someone might have
	- Tell them what is in it for them, get them excited
	- Exaggerate the issues people are having, the things they are struggling with
		- Then tell the customer how this product will solve the issue
	- You can pick a problem in each email and provide a solution
	- It's ok to recycle the same points, just say them a different way
		- Note that not everyone will read every email
	- Text on the off days
		- One bullet summary of previous email
- 1 day to go
	- Just send an email saying one day left, no copy needed
- Launch day
	- Email 6 times that day
		- The reason is you want to be at the top of their inbox
	- They can be as simple as 4 hours left
	- If you have their phone numbers
		- Text them
			- Keep them super short
			- Distill the emails into one bullet
			- Have a link so they can sign up
- Note on the last 48 hours
	- Your goal is to push the link to the sign up page
	- They don't need to buy the product at this point
	- The easiest thing to do is to opt in and schedule an appointment
		- At the appointment, you get them to sign up and actually make the purchase
	- If it’s a warm list of clients you already have, the link should be to schedule an appointment
	- Note you will have no shows
	- Have consultations every 30 minutes
	- Have a referral program
		- Bring a friend and give them a discount (from 2800 to 4000)
