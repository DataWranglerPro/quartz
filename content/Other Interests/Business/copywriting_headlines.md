1. AIDA is a framework for writing the body copy.

	1. A – Attention

		- At the very beginning of your copy you should grab the attention of your prospects.
		- You do that by what’s called using a “hook”.

“Do you want to generate passive income online in an absolutely legit and honest way?
Have you had enough of shiny objects, promising you to “magically” make you a millionaire?
Do you want to teach online, have thousands of students praising you on a daily basis that your
courses have solved their most urgent problems?
Do you want to build your social network to the next level? (I’ve got students from 128 countries
and I made enormous amount of friends and business partnerships.)
If your answer is “YES” to even one of these questions… then this email will knock you off your
feet.
Hey,
Vladimir here –“

	1. I – Interest
	
		- Write about the benefits of your product, not the features!
		- Features tell, benefits sell!

“2. Create Your Online Course In The Easiest And Fastest Way. To be completely honest there are
different ways to produce content for an online course.
In this section I will teach you THE fastest and easiest way. Plus you don’t have to buy any
equipment to get started, because I provide you with FREE resources (software) to help you do the
work.
I mean, there isn’t any other business like online teaching, because you can start with no investment
upfront.”

	1. D – Desire
	
		- Paint pleasing pictures in your prospect’s mind.
		- “Imagine what it would be if you had…”
		- “Just picture yourself for a moment having or doing something desirable.”

“Please, picture yourself for a moment having 10000 students from all around the globe who are grateful to you… how would you feel about that?
Imagine having friends from all over the world who are open to go on a business venture with you,
because they TRUST you!
… And you have the opportunity to achieve all that quickly and easily by taking my course. To save yourself hundreds of hours of hard work and build a solid student base that is eager to enroll in your next course.”

	1. A- Action
	
		- You must have a call to action at the end of your copy!
		- Tell the prospect exactly what you want them to do.
		- Connect the main benefit with the call to action.

“Go ahead and click the “Take This Course” button on the page that will open when you click this link: 
http://
Stop overthinking… there is no need. After all, what is the worst thing that could happen?
You enroll in the course and for some reason you don’t like it - you can get your money back with a click of a button. However, I highly doubt it because so far out of over 1000 students, nobody requested refund, which is indicative of the high quality you will get.
By the way, 30 days is enough time for you to launch 2 courses that will cover your investment multiple times in the near future.
I’ll see you inside the course.
To your success,
-Vladimir Raykov”
THANK YOU
