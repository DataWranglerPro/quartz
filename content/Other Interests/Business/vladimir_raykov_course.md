# 8 elements of a highly convertible offer

- Framing your value proposition and translating value
	- Address these questions
		- How do I know that what I am paying for is worth a lot more than my investment?
		- What is their dream outcome?
	- Example1 on how to create value
		- If I am selling a time management course that costs $497. Let's be conservative and assume my program only saves you one hour per day. If you make $50k per year that is $25 per hour. You will be saving $500 worth of your time every month and $6000 worth of your time every year that you can invest in important projects.
			- This makes it seem like the $497 course is a bargain
	- The goal is to set up the customer with the frame of mind of how much your service is worth and then present the price.
	- How to convert features into benefits?
		- Formula = Because it has (feature). You will be able to (advantage). What that means to you is (benefit)
	- Use power words (257, see download folder)
- Clear communication
	- Marketing is communication
	- The ladder of abstraction
		- Make sure you communication is clear and not abstract. Be more specific if needed.
- Social proof/testimonials
	- Can you proof what you promise?
	- Video (the most powerful)
		- Does not need to be fancy and just a few minutes
		- Ask you customers to leave you a testimonial
	- Written
	- Customer/subscriber/visitor counters
	- Reviews and ratings
	- Trust seals and media logos
	- Testimonials are used to build credibility and trust
- Urgency
	- Causes people to act quickly
	- Use scarcity of quantity to create urgency (limit the quantity)
		- Ie. The people who agree to mee this week get……
	- Use a time limit (count down timer)
		- Try to change the color of the timer when it gets below a certain number
	- Example1
		- Let me know ASAP by replying because I've asked several Realtors but I can take only 3 appointments this month
- Bonuses and incentives
	- Bonuses have to be relevant to your main offer

Hello,

My name is David Rojas, Sales and Marketing for Exit Realty Preferred Triangle, the only Real Estate company with exclusive deals with Facebook and Google.

Last month we hired a Realtor that was not happy with her firm (she was working for Remax). She mentioned she was not getting the on-on-one training she is now getting at EXIT.

Since EXIT has a goal to grow, we'd like to invite more agents to work along side us.

For that reason, we are offering a free year with EXIT (a $295 value).

That means you won't be charged for joining EXIT.

You get on-on-one training, leads (and close some), we get to grow. Win-win.

Let me know ASAP by replying because I've asked several Realtors but I can take only 3 appointments this month.

Let's get on a quick call to see if there is a fit.

Looking forward to it!

- David
