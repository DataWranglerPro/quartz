``` prompt
Here are the instructions you will follow to generate a random Python pandas challenge for fintech professionals:
Challenge Generation Instructions
Challenge Description: Write a clear and concise description of the challenge, including the problem statement, make it sound like a story you are telling a friend.
Please avoid tasks that involve: 
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
Tasks: Create 3 tasks that identify specific pain points that pandas solves. Make sure you stick to Data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, feature engineering, Data merging, joining, reshaping and pivoting. 
Data Generation: Write code to generate a sample dataset that represents a real-world scenario, using libraries like numpy and pandas.
Data Size: Ensure the dataset is large enough to require efficient pandas operations, but not so large that it becomes unwieldy.
Complexity: Design the challenge to require intermediate to advanced pandas skills.
Summary of data: Provide a description of the dataset and column definitions

also please avoid these topics:
Movie Madness
E-commerce Sales Analysis
Energy consumption
Flight Frenzy
Saving the Music Festival
Financial Fiasco: A Bank's Dilemma
logistics
agricultural
telecom company
School District
Bike Rental
Healthcare
portfolio analysis
trading
```

# Create Notebook
Here we actually use the ideas generated by the prompt above and solve the challenge using Pandas. 

- Use a past Notebook to keep consistent format and style
	- Print version numbers
	- Link to hedaro.com at the bottom


# Post Production
Here we use AI to check our work for grammatical mistakes and coding mistakes.

**Add a summary at the end:**
``` prompt
Can you summarize the Pandas tutorial below and provide in bullets what the reader learned. Are you ready?
```

**Check for Errors:**
``` prompt
look for grammatical mistakes in the content below. tell me the issues found but do not rewrite my content. Are you ready?
```

**Check for incorrect code or statements:**
``` prompt
Look for any code errors or incorrect statements in the content below. tell me the issues found but do not rewrite my content. Are you ready?
```

**Check for Errors, incorrect code or statements:**
``` prompt
identify any:

- Grammatical mistakes
- Code errors (if the content contains code snippets)
- Incorrect statements (logical or factual errors)
    

List out the issues without rewriting my content. Are you ready?
```


# Copy Notebook to Hedaro.com
Here we convert the Notebook file into Markdown, we also include the Notebook file so it can be used by NBViewer.

- Make a copy of an old note in Obsidian
- Copy paste into the new note
- Make edits, add pictures, fix links, fix markdown tables
- Add .ipynb file
	- C:\\hedaro\\hedaro\\Assets\\notebooks
- Push to github
	- cd C:\\hedaro\\website\\quartz
	- npx quartz sync --no-pull
- Generate NBViewer link, update note, and repush to Github
	- https://nbviewer.org/
	- https://github.com/DataWranglerPro/quartz/tree/v4/content/Assets/notebooks
	- Copy .ipynb link and generate an NBViewer link


# Write Linkedin Article
Here we transfer the Notebook to Linkedin and write the copy for the post.

- Add header
```
**Let's connect!** Send me a connection invitation. I regularly share Jupyter Notebooks on Pandas and would love to expand my network.

**P.S.**

**Explore my profile**: Head to my profile to see more about my work, skills, and experience.

**If you're feeling generous**: Repost this article with your network and help spread the word!
```

- Copy/paste from notebook
- Make edits, add pictures, fix links, fix tables
- Create post image in Canva
- Update seo description
```
create me an seo description of the content below. Make it at most 160 characters in length. are you ready?
```

# Write Linkedin Post
Here we make the post to the article
* Use the Linkedin formatter
	* https://www.linkedin-makeover.com/linkedin-text-formatter/

```
Here are the steps you will take to create a short LinkedIn post that captures the attention of fintech, data analysts, and data scientists professionals:

1. # Craft a hook I'll start with a hook that grabs the attention of the target audience, using an icon and a question that resonates with their interests.
    
2. **Describe the scenario**: I'll describe a scenario that is relevant to fintech, data analysts, and data scientists, highlighting a common challenge they face in their work.
    
3. **Summarize the content**: 
- I'll summarize the content of the tutorial, highlighting what they will learn.
- Use bullet points (e.g. -, :, â€¢) to break up the list
- Make sure to list what they will learn after reading the tutorial
    
4. **Include a call-to-action**: I'll include a call-to-action, inviting the audience to read the full tutorial by clicking on the link.
    
5. **Use relevant hashtags**: I'll use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience and make the post discoverable by fintech, data analysts, and data scientists professionals.

6. **Add a P.S. adthe bottom**: Ask a question. Make it light hearted, funny, and related to the tutorial

7. Do not start until i give you the content. got it?
```
