   - Use WPAmWPA2 Enterprise instead
- Captive portals
   - Suggest to not use captive portals as they are not secure
   - Use WPA/WPA2 enterprise instead with each user having a unique password
- WEP
   - Do not use WEP as they are not secure
- WPS
   - Do not use WPS as they are not secure
      - Disable WPS
   - If they still want to use it
      - enable PBC (push button authentication)
      - Rate limit and lock after 3 failed attempts
- WAP/WPA2
