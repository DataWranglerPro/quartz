# Fix wifi adapter not being recognized by Kali:
``` sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
sudo reboot now
```

Here are the current usb drivers used and it shows you the chipset:
``` sh
â”€$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:8812 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8812AU 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2T2R DB WLAN Adapter

sudo apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms 
sudo apt install dkms 
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au 
cd rtl8812au/ 
make 
sudo make install 
iwconfig 
```

**Note:** if iwconfig does not show you the wifi adapter, unplug and plug usb adaptor again

# For an Adapter that you have previously Setup:
- Start and log into Kali
- Plug in Wireless Adapter
- Devices > USB > Realtek 802.11n NIC

- ifconfig & iwconfig
   - you should see wlan0
   - Adapter will be in managed mode
   - MAC address of adapter will reset to factory one
- Change MAC adddress
   - first disable the interface
      - ifconfig wlan0 down
   - ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
   - enable the interface
      - ifconfig wlan0 up
   - ifconfig
      - you may have to try the steps a few times to get it to work
- Change to monitor mode:
   - mode=managed, the default setting
   - Only packets with its destination MAC Address that match the wifi adapter are captured
   - ifconfig wlan0 down
   - Run this command to fix any potential issues (not required)
      - airmon-ng check kill
   - enable monitor mode
      - iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
      - as an alternative
         - airmon-ng start wlan0
   - ifconfig wlan0 up
   - iwconfig

- If you can see the wlan adaptor and place it into monitor mode, but cannot actually scan:
	- reinstalling the drivers and restarting network manager fixed this issue for me
``` sh
sudo apt remove realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms 
sudo apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms
sudo service NetworkManager restart
iwconfig
```
