Network to network communication is done via Routers. Routers communicate using Layer 3 of the OSI model which uses IP Addresses.

# 192.168.1.0/24
/24 helps represent:
- Which part of the IP Address is the network
- Which part of the IP Address is the PC
- In a /24 network, the first three sets of numbers represent the network and the last number represents the end device.

# IP Addresses
- Consist of a network and host portion
- Are 32 bits in length
- Are normally written in dotted decimal (i.e. 255.255.255.0)

**Network Address** - When the host portion of the IP Address is all zero's
- Cannot be assigned to a host
- It is the first address of the network

**Broadcast Address** - When the host portion of the IP address is all 255
- Cannot be assigned to a host
- It is the first address of the network
- Is used to send network traffic to all hosts on the network
