My wife has from time to time, purchased several Christian books to my mother who is Catholic. She told me she has read them, but I don't think she has found Jesus through those books. 

On a recent trip to my parent's house, she told me she purchased a book for me and my wife to read. It is about the virgin Mary.

It sat in a plastic bag for a while, but I finally decided to crack it open. It is only 62 pages long, so it is really a quick read.

The back of the book reads "Mary is the safest, shortest and most perfect way to go to Jesus." Yes, my eyes almost popped out of my head. 

After reading about 10 pages of the book, I realized that this book is not based on the bible and frankly I am not sure where a lot of these ideas came from.

The ideas and concepts presented here are so far from what the bible teaches, that I was taken by surprise. The book does a really good job at attempting to persuade and use repetition to make the reader believe in what it says. This made me realize that I needed to get back in the word and ground myself so I can make sure I can 100% clearly differentiate what is truth and what is something else.

I also thought it would be a great book to show my family what the bible says versus what this book says about Mary and Jesus.
