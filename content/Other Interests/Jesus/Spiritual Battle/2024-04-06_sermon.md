# Physically Walking and Claiming Territories

## Deuteronomy 11:22-24
22 
If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow--to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him-- 
###### 23 
then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. 
###### 24 
Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. 

- Joshua 1:3-4 (NIV): "I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates—all the Hittite country—to the Mediterranean Sea in the west." This passage speaks about God's promise to Joshua and the Israelites as they were about to enter the Promised Land. It can be seen as a metaphor for physically walking through and claiming territories while trusting in God's promises.
- Joshua 6:1-5 (NIV): "Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. Then the Lord said to Joshua, 'See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.'"
- 2 Chronicles 20:21-22 (NIV): "After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the Lord and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: 'Give thanks to the Lord, for his love endures forever.' As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated."

# How to Prayer Walk
These are notes I took while on a mission trip to Ecuador, a very spiritually dark place. 

- Power hierarchy in Cotacachi, Ecuador (witches over the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church over the people

- Why do we physically walk the streets?
	- Physical actions combined with prayer to impact spiritual realms and claim territories for God's glory

- Practical advice
	- Ask the Lord to forgive the sins of the people
	- If the Holy Spirit prompts you to talk to someone, do it
	- Ask the Lord to reveal something to you
	- Pray for solutions
		- Thank Jesus for something he is going to do in this city
	- Be spiritually perceptive
	- Be persistent, you may need to re-walk areas
	- Pray on street corners

# The process

- Worship (~ 30 minutes+)
	- Youtube songs
	- Live misuc
- Teaching time
	- Tell them why and how to prayer walk
- Walk the streets
	- What do we do while we walk?
		- see practical advice above

The next day or the next week, repeat the process

- If you feel the Holy Spirit telling you its time, start knocking on people's homes.
	- Invite them to church
	- Ask them if they need prayer
	- Let the Holy Spirit guide you
