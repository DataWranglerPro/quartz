- John is the apostle John
- The details in the letter are not spoken to John, they are shown
- John is telling us in Revelation what he saw

> 1 The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, 2 who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.

- This letter as seen in verse 1 is for us Christians ("show his servants")
- This is the only book in the bible that says he who studies it will be blessed
- The letter is written to the seven churches in Asia minor
	- 7 in the bible means 100%, perfection, completion
	- These seven churches represent the 7 phases of the church throughout all time
- The seven churches
	- Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.
	- All of these churches were present in south east turkey (Asia minor)

> 12 I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, 13 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. 16 In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.

- Priests, person who intercedes for another (Christians > Jesus (priest) > God | unbelieving world > Christians (priest) > Jesus)
- Daniel 10:4-6, 7:9, Rev 19:11-16 have a similar description of Jesus
- Isaiah 11 explains a little more some of the details
	- 4 He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
- Jesus is glowing white which represents his holiness/kingship, his sash is his faithfulness, his eyes of fire is discernment, his face shines like the sun represents the light of the truth, his glowing bronze feet represents judgement and he tramples his wrath on the unrighteous.
- This is a preview of what he will look like in the second coming not like he looked like in the Gospels

> 19 “Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.

- Rev 1:19 tells the outline of the entire letter
	- Things that have already happened (ch 1)
	- Things that currently are (ch 2-3)
	- Things that will happen in the future (ch 4-22)
