- The official start of the church was Pentecost
- The apostles were alive in this time and that is why they had sound teaching
- Paul's definition of a Christian: a true Christian is someone who is led by the Holy Spirit and has the Spirit dwelling within them
	- Romans 8:9-11, 9 You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. 10 But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness. 11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.
