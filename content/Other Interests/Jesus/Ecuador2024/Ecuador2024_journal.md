I will try to jot down as much as I can and share with you all my experiences preparing and navigating through my first Mission trip. 

# November 2023
Signing up to be part of the Ecuador team was pretty simple, I just filled out an online form and sent a few emails. Soon enough I was contacted by the team leader Tim and had a short conversation over the phone. I was told most of the activity and information was probably going to be given after the new year.

# December 2023
I was asked to join some sort of online portal where I was going to be told about the details of the mission trip, meeting times, and forms to fill out. I was happy to see more information about where I was going as at this point not much about the trip was shared with me. I believe Tim told me that he expected a big group of around 25 people going to Ecuador.

I finally got around to signing all the required forms, making copies of my passport, and sending it all over to the Ecuador team for review. So far, nothing out of the ordinary for me, and at this point it just seemed like all I was doing was completing some paperwork to head out on a trip. Now, where things started to get out of my comfort zone, was when I was asked to write the [[Ecuador2024_supportLetter|Support Letter]].

As a missionary, it is customary at least in what I have heard and seen, that the missionary asks or raises the funding needed to cover all costs associated from going to a mission trip. You have to understand that this is very very foreign to me. I normally do not expect people to help me and normally I do not want any help of any kind. Yes, even if I need it. So asking for money, was actually not my original plan. I was planning to simply pull money out of my bank account and pay for the whole trip, at $2,500 this was going to be a significant expense. I also did not think I would get enough people to give me any money, so what was the point anyways. I was actually expecting some of my family and friends to get mad at me for even asking them for money. 

Luckily, God gave me a wife, that encouraged me to create a [[Ecuador2024_supportLetter|support letter]] and ask friends and family to support me financially. So I sat down at my computer and started to type away the story of the events that lead me to even think about going on a mission trip. I then made a list of **42** contacts, some where emails and some where physical addresses. I was a bit nervous about sending out the letter, I really have no idea how people, specially my family members are going to react. My wife also told me to pray to Jesus and ask him to provide the money, pray to him everyday. 

The sixth of January is when I first started to send the letters and send the emails. To my surprise, I actually got first contacted by my good friends from College and I got some great responses from them. I was very excited and was totally blown away from their kind words and generosity. I remember 5 persons quickly sent me support. This is how I knew that Jesus was the only one I could give credit to this result as I obviously have no idea what I am doing and I am doubting the process the entire time.

Now this part of the story is not known by a lot of you. I actually had a payment processing account with a company when I was trying to sell Microsoft Excel services. This same company is the company I used to collect my donations for Ecuador. Soon after I started receiving funds, the payment processing company froze my account, and told me since I was not a 501(c)(3) Charitable Organization I was not able to collect donations using their service. This was such a blow to me, I literally had to refund everyone, and send an apology email. I knew this did not look good at all, and my support went all the way back down to zero. Till this day, I am still told by people that they tried to give me money but the link I shared with them did not work. What a nightmare! Luckily the church has a way to collect the money legally and they will apply those funds to the missions cost that I am responsible for. 

Another blessing in disguise was that there was some riots in Ecuador during this time and that caused plane tickets to Ecuador to go down in price. The local church we are partnered with said we will be safe and during my research it seemed like it was just local gangs/criminal organizations causing trouble among themselves and the police. This also means the amount I had to raise went from $2,500 down to $1,800. 

The team meetings are going well, the group is slowly getting to know each other and we are getting more information on the situation in Ecuador and what we will be doing there. It seems that we will be playing with kids, feeding them, and sharing Jesus to them. It has not been very clear what we will do for the rest of the time as it seems that will be directed by the local church leaders in Ecuador. I was also told that the village is about 2 hours away via bus and they speak some other language that is not Spanish. I thought I was going to be able to talk to these people in Spanish but the people in the mountains is an unreached group and they speak [[kitchwa]].

# February 2024
We were given a book to read titled "The Awe of God" by John Bevere and an [evangelism cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zETUh50u8Vs). The cube can be opened, twisted, and moved around. It has a progression and talks about Sin (separation from God/man), Jesus (birth, death, and resurrection), how to go to heaven (confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that he was raised from the dead). I have used it with my two girls and they really enjoy playing with the cube. We are told to practice using the cube as we will be using them in the missions trip. 

We also finally have an official itinerary of our flights, it seems we will be using Atlanta to send us off to Ecuador. I also need it so I know when to be at the airport and when to ask my wife to pick me back up when I am back in the states.

I was told there will be internet in the hotel we are staying at, but I do not plan to bring a laptop. I will be writing everything down in a notebook and I will have to then type it on the computer when I get back. I will try to take some pictures as well. We head out March 18th, so there is less than a month to go. I have been sick a lot of this month (very out of the norm for me), so I am hoping my health is at its best when March comes around. 

I was also asked to have my trip funded by March 11th, I still need around $400, please pray I get the last bit in before then.
