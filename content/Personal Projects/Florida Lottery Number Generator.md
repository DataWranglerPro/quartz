My dad used to always play the Florida lottery and other lottery games in hopes to win and buy me and my sister a house/apartment. I decided to make him a program that analyzed the winning numbers and look for patterns. I do believe it also generated numbers for him. I also do not think he did anything with it. I coded this using [[vbScript]] and [[Microsoft Access]]
