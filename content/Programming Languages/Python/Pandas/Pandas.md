A [[Python]] [[Data Analysis]] library.

I made a set of 11 Pandas lessons and this was my most popular tutorial series to date. They were [[Jupyter Notebook|Jupyter Notebooks]] and I hosted them in [[bitbucket]]. I created a system that emailed the tutorials once a week via [[mailerlite]] and used [[gumroad]] to collect any sales from sales pitches I asked for after they signed up for the free Pandas lessons. 

## Here are the lessons:
- [[pandas - lesson 01]]
- [[pandas - lesson 02]]
- [[pandas - lesson 03]]
- [[pandas - lesson 04]]
- [[pandas - lesson 05]]
- [[pandas - lesson 06]]
