# Soccer Stats Showdown  

### Description: 
Imagine you're the Data Scientist for a professional soccer league. The season is heating up, and the league wants to gain insights into team and player performance. They've collected a vast dataset of match statistics, but it's a bit of a mess. That's where you come in!  

### Tasks:  
- **Goal Scoring Analysis:** Calculate the top 5 teams with the highest median goal scoring per match, and display the results in a bar chart.  
- **Player Performance:** Create a histogram showing the distribution of assists among all players in the season.
- **Matchup Insights:** Determine the teams with the highest winning percentage when playing at home, and display the results in a sorted table.

```python
# import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sys

print('Python version ' + sys.version)
print('Pandas version ' + pd.__version__)
print('Numpy version ' + np.__version__)
```

# The Data  

This dataset contains 500 matches, with team and player performance statistics. Your task is to wrangle this data using pandas to extract valuable insights!  

### Columns:  
- **match_id:** a unique identifier for each match.
- **team_home and team_away:** IDs of the teams playing in each match, ranging from 0 to 19. These IDs don't correspond to specific team names, but rather represent different teams in the simulation.  
- **goals_home and goals_away:** the number of goals scored by each team in each match.
- **player_assists and player_goals:** the number of assists and goals scored by a player in each match. 

Good luck, and have fun!

```python
# set the seed
np.random.seed(0)

# declare variables
matches = 500
teams = 20
players = 500

data = {
    'match_id': np.arange(matches),
    'team_home': np.random.choice(teams, matches),
    'team_away': np.random.choice(teams, matches),
    'goals_home': np.random.poisson(lam=1.5, size=matches),
    'goals_away': np.random.poisson(lam=1.0, size=matches)
}

# create dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# ensure player does not score more than the team
df['player_goals'] = df.apply(lambda x: np.minimum(np.random.poisson(lam=0.2, size=1), np.maximum(np.random.choice([x['goals_home'], x['goals_away']], 1), 0))[0], axis=1)

# ensure player does have more assists than goals scored
df['player_assists'] = df.apply(lambda x: np.minimum(np.random.poisson(lam=0.2, size=1), np.maximum(np.random.choice([x['player_goals']], 1), 0))[0], axis=1)

df.head()
```

|     | match_id | team_home | team_away | goals_home | goals_away | player_goals | player_assists |
| --- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 0   | 0        | 12        | 0         | 2          | 0          | 0            | 0              |
| 1   | 1        | 15        | 9         | 0          | 0          | 0            | 0              |
| 2   | 2        | 0         | 16        | 3          | 2          | 1            | 0              |
| 3   | 3        | 3         | 2         | 0          | 2          | 0            | 0              |

We are expecting all of the columns to be numeric, let's take a look and verify this.


```python
df.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 500 entries, 0 to 499
    Data columns (total 7 columns):
     #   Column          Non-Null Count  Dtype
    ---  ------          --------------  -----
     0   match_id        500 non-null    int32
     1   team_home       500 non-null    int32
     2   team_away       500 non-null    int32

# Goal Scoring Analysis:

Calculate the top 5 teams with the highest goal scoring average per match, and display the results in a bar chart.

```python
home = df[['team_home','goals_home']]
home
```

|     | team_home | goals_home |
| --- | --------- | ---------- |
| 0   | 12        | 2          |
| 1   | 15        | 0          |
| 2   | 0         | 3          |
| 3   | 3         | 0          |
| 4   | 3         | 2          |
| ... | ...       | ...        |
| 495 | 18        | 0          |
| 496 | 14        | 2          |
| 497 | 18        | 0          |
| 498 | 1         | 0          |
| 499 | 12        | 1          |
500 rows Ã— 2 columns

**Note:** We will try to use the median as the data is not Normally distributed.

You can see that for most of the away matches, the teams seem to score a median of 1 goal. For games where they have a home field advantage, we have a few teams scoring a median of 2 goals per game.

```python
# home team
group = df.groupby('team_home')
group_home = group['goals_home'].median()

# away team
group = df.groupby('team_away')
group_away = group['goals_away'].median()

# combine data
combined = pd.concat([group_home, group_away], axis=1)

combined.plot.bar();
```

![[output_9_0.png]]

Let's pull out top 5 scoring teams based on the median goals scored at home games. There was a tie for 5th place, team 18 and team 15 both scored a median of 1.5 goals per home game.

```python
group_home.sort_values(ascending=False).head()
```

    team_home
    11    2.0
    17    2.0
    4     2.0
    5     2.0
    18    1.5
    Name: goals_home, dtype: float64


# Player Performance:  

Create a histogram showing the distribution of assists among all players in the season.

As you can see, most players do not have many assists according to the data

```python
df['player_assists'].sort_values().hist();
```

![[output_14_0.png]]

If we take a look at some descriptive statistics, we can conclude that there were very few high scoring/assisting players in the season.

```python
df[['goals_home','goals_away','player_goals','player_assists']].describe()
```

|       | goals_home | goals_away | player_goals | player_assists |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| count | 500.000000 | 500.000000 | 500.000000   | 500.000000     |
| mean  | 1.492000   | 1.040000   | 0.134000     | 0.026000       |
| std   | 1.221852   | 0.990132   | 0.352552     | 0.159295       |
| min   | 0.000000   | 0.000000   | 0.000000     | 0.000000       |
| 25%   | 1.000000   | 0.000000   | 0.000000     | 0.000000       |
| 50%   | 1.000000   | 1.000000   | 0.000000     | 0.000000       |
| 75%   | 2.000000   | 2.000000   | 0.000000     | 0.000000       |
| max   | 6.000000   | 5.000000   | 2.000000     | 1.000000       |
