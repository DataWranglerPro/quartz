Here I list everything related to my experience with Web Programming. 

**My motivation:**
The main reason I wanted to learn web programming was very simple. I had the skills to work with data and I had learned a lot of math. The issue was that all of these tools were stuck in my local computer and I wanted to be able to harness this power over the internet. Having the ability to work with data and use the math I learned on my very own website seemed magical to me. 

*I have experience with:* 
* **Backend Development** - This is the server and any other process that happens behind the browser
	* database calls
	* data validation on the server
	* Libraries I have used:
		* [[Basic Tornado Application]] - This is the [[Python]] library I used to create the backend server for anything web related 
* **Frontend Development** - Anything that happens on the Browser
	* User Interface Design
		* [[bootstrap]] - This front end framework helped me create "good" looking websites very easily. I was also able to create navigation bars, tables, div, and other common html elements very easily.
		* [[d3.js]] - visualization library that allowed me to make beautiful charts using data. This is a very low level language so unless you love this kind of work, you will eventually use a higher level visualization library like [[dc.js]].
		* [[dc.js]] - visualization library build on top of [[d3.js]] that allowed to create my charts much faster. It also made them interactive and required me to not get too in the weeds.
		* [[leaflet.js]] - This is the library I used to map data points into a world map using latitude and longitude coordinates. The map is interactive and it took very little resources.
* **Platform as a Service** - for deploying, managing, and scaling web applications
	* [[Heroku]] - The third party service that allowed me to host my web application
		* They have a free tier and that is what I have mainly used
